# DNN-binaural-localization
1. Simulate directional sound with head related impulse responses (HRIRs)
2. Train a deep neural network (DNN) to locate sound sources
3. Evaluate the DNN and analyse it with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)

This repository contains the source code of my Bachelor thesis with the topic "An Analysis of Binaural Localization Models with Explainable Machine Learning Methods". A PDF version is available on my website: http://pretzelsolution.com/binaural-localization

# Code structure
* **1_data_presentation.ipynb**: Visually investigation of the HRIR database, directional sound simulation and decision of which preprocessing is applied for the input feature vector. Interaural level difference (ILD) has been chosen.
* **2_training.ipynb**: DNN training with grid search hyperparameter optimization
* **3_evaluation.ipynb**: Evaluate DNNs with different error metrics and explain its predictions with LRP
* **custom_dataset_class.ipynb**: Additional dataset class which can be used to conduct memory efficiant preprocessing in batches

# Quickstart
Copy the repository to your google drive and run the notebooks with colab.
